I. Course Overview  
In classic embedded system design, hardware and software components are developed independently by separate design teams. This leads to a slow and inefficient design process. There is general agreement in the design community that a combined consideration of hardware and software design issues will lead to more efficient systems and a more efficient design process. This course, targeted at computer engineers, addresses these issues. The course provides an introduction in hardware-software co-design. It outlines the basic strengths of hardware and software implementations and shows how to combine those into a successful system design. The focus is on the commonalities in the design process of hardware and software.

II. Learning Outcomes  
A student that has successfully completed this course should be able to:  
 Develop Python codes to implement high-level applications.  
 Develop digital circuits using FPGA and Xilinx Development tool.  
 Develop ARM and FPGA based BareMetal embedded system design.  
 Explore hardware and software design alternatives.  
 Identify performance bottlenecks in a given hardware-software architecture and optimize them by transformations on hardware and software components.  
 Analyze and explain the control-flow and data-flow of a software program and a cycle-based hardware description
